Cloud computing ---> on demand in server providing platform
                ---> AWS GCP Azure
                ---> can be used using remote

DataServers ---> maintains all the servers connected with internet
            ---> can easily allocate server storage

Virtualization ---> sharing the server(Hypervizers)
               ---> client using a part of server

infra ---> on-premises server+ cloud server ---> structure,storage,data
 
Server ---> machine used to store data

Hypervizer ---> one server can be converted into more than one server
           ---> used as chunks
           ---> acts as middleware


Cloud Services---> Platform as service --->Os is maintained by server --> Applicatn and data 
                   Infrastructure as service ---> Cost effective ---> Virtualization,server,storage,Network
                   Software as service ---> software is maintained ---> All maintained by us

Low Level  ---> Planning team ---> Implementataion team ---> Operation team ---> Deploy 

AWS Performance ---> it has 217 services
                Example:
                ---> compute 
                ---> storage
                ---> migration

Advantages of AWS: 
     
     ---> Easy to use
     ---> Flexible
     ---> Cost-effective
     ---> Reliable
     ---> Scalable and High-performance    

AWS ---> first Cloud service 
    ---> started in 2006  

Class Time Table:

DAY 1 ---> Cloud Intro
DAy 2 ---> EC2 (Server)
Day 3 ---> S3 (Storage)
DAY 4 ---> IAM (Security)
DAY 5 ---> AutoScaling (Server)
DAY 6 ---> VPC (Network)


Cloud computing ---> server providing platform
                ---> AWS literally has about 217 services
                ---> each region has minimum 3 availability zones
                ---> AWS was the first to provide cloud services in the year 2006
