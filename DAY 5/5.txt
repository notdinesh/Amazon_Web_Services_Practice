AutoScaling
===========

Majorly used services in AWS 

EC2 --> Server maintainance (instance,AMI,Snapshots,Keypairs,Autoscaling,LoadBalancing)
    --> Snapshots --> backups
    --> virtual servers --> instances
    --> Autoscaling --> to scaleup or scaledown the number of servers.

S3
VPC
RDS
R53
IAM

--> If we have more number of users , the application will use more than one user because if the request
    from user crosses the capacity of the server, performance of the server gets down , which inturn downs the application
    alos leads to server crash

IOP --> Input Output Persecond

there is an entity called LOAD BALANCER --> transfer the request to server which is free

Load Balancer --> distributes application network traffic among the servers equally.
=============

--> Initially during Application release,the number of users are predicted and servers were alloted
--> IF number of users incresed overnight, we can manipulate the servers using AUTOSCALING

AUTOSCALING --> increase(scaleup) or decrease(scaleup) the number servers based on number of users.
=========== --> gradually increase or decrease no of servers depending on server usage.

Autoscaling --> Launch Configuration --> Explain to autoscaling with our required configuration
            --> Auto-scaling Group --> setting min and max servers
 
FAQ
===
Autoscaling --> What? --> manipulates the number of servers based on usage of an application .
            --> Why? --> prevents applicaion from slowing down, even crashing.  
            --> Example : Popcorn counters in theaters
            --> Part of EC2

STEPS
EC2 --> Auto Scaling --> Launch Configiration --> Launch Configiration --> name(Own choice) --> AMI(Instances --> Launch Instance --> click linux --> copy the AMI ID) --> Add AMI 
    --> taking our AMI , becus Our config will be same for the instances --> Istance type(t2.micro) --> Skip additional settings --> rules(SSH,HTTP,HTTPS --> IP(Anywhere)) --> keypair(Existing(linux)) --> lauch Autoscaling

Auto Scaling group --> Create AutoScaling group --> NAme(own choise) --> Give "Switch to Launch Configuratn "

Launch Config --> Can't edit --> Read -only
Lauch Template -- Can edit --> select the created config in drop down --> click next --> Network(Available zone -->select min. 3) --> next --> LoadBalancer(click "No load balancer") --> next --> Group size(Desired(2),minimum(1),maximum(5)) --> 
               -->Scaling policies(none) --> next > 2(if notificatn needed give or skip) --> next --> Create Auto scaling group

Desired capacity --> servers for instances immediately use
Min capacity --> min servers req.
MAx capacity --> max servers req.
