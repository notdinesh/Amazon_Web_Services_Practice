Application load balancer --> two things --> Network traffic distribution
=========================
                                         --> health check
  --> When we have more than one appication , it will be difficult to do health check as well as network traffic distribution.

Load balancer is split into two . they are,
 --> Load Balancer --> forward network traffic.
 --> Target group --> for each set of servers.We need target group . 

     Depending upon the application we need to create target group 

STEPS
=====

Load balancer --> targer groups --> create --> instance --> give a name --> Protocol(Skip) --> VPC (Default) --> health Check(type"/gmail/index.html") 
--> next --> select the req. server(server2) --> then click "include as pending below" --> click "create target group".

Loadbalancer --> create load balancer --> give name --> scheme(Internet-facing) --> IPV4 --> VPC(DEfault) --> MApping(Select atleast 3 --> depending upon region)
--> Security(Remove Default & choose highest wizard) --> Listeners and routing (select any one default group) --> create load balancer

Loadbalancer --> Listeners --> HTTP:80 --> Rules --> Manage rule --> add rule --> insert rule --> add condition --> path --> put "/gmail*" in the below box --> add action --> forward to --> select the target group --> create --> then go back and click the load balancer
--> copy the DNS name and paste it in chrome --> (eg :LoadBalancer-580018117.ap-northeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/gmail) or (LoadBalancer-580018117.ap-northeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/photo).

VOLUMES
=======
  --> From server we can attach or detach from server

three ways  
  --> EXisting volume modification (Modifying volume)
  --> Adding a new volme (Attaching volume)
  --> Deleting the volume (Detaching volume)

STEPS
=====
EBS --> Volume --> create volume --> type(General Purpose) --> size(100 GB) --> available zone should be equal to the zone which we work --> create
--> select volume instance --> cilck 'Actions" --> then add volume to the instance

We cannot reduce the volume of the instance --> but we can stop the instance , dete the existing one, creating another volume and adding it
